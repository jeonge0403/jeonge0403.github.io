  <h2>Cuteness</h2>
  <p>
    A person can be attractive and boyish if they have features that are found on attractive people in general (for whatever your personal definition of "attractive" is), but do not have too many prominent features of sexual development in men - for instance, male-pattern baldness, prominent facial or body hair, etc. Note that neotenic (i.e. child-like) physical features also count here - such as having large, expressive eyes and clear skin.
Personality-wise, "cute" traits for men tend to be the positive traits associated with children in general - such as playfulness, offering bright-eyed smiles frequently, etc. - and/or with male children in particular - such as physicality, reckless enthusiasm, endearing sloppiness, etc.
You don't need to be a young man to have boyish features, but they are certainly more common on younger men than not.<br>
In this sense, "cute" is often contrasted with "handsome" - which is used to refer to attractive traits that are associated with male sexual development.
