  Being in commitment is easy but sticking to it maintaining the same love throughout life thats kinda big deal.
  Very few people have already made it to their old-age and many are trying but there are some who don't know meaning of true love like cutting your hand for your partner isn't considered true love or is it or threating them if they don't be with them they will cut their hand is this true love . No definetely not if you truely love somone you will not force them to be with you . You will let them decide and if they also love you truely they will be with you no matter what happens. In the end i want to say that love is made true love it can never be found . True love in which both care both argue and most importantly both love.</p>
